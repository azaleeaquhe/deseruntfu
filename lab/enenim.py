def web_hop(privatekey):
    """
    web_hop is a function that takes a private key as input and returns a new private key.
    The new private key is generated by hopping around the web, using a series of web services to generate a new key.
    The function uses the following steps:

    1. Generate a new key pair using the `ecdsa` library.
    2. Convert the private key to a PEM-encoded string.
    3. Send the PEM-encoded string to a web service that generates a new key.
    4. Receive the new key from the web service and convert it to a PEM-encoded string.
    5. Send the new PEM-encoded string to another web service that generates a new key.
    6. Receive the new key from the web service and convert it to a PEM-encoded string.
    7. Return the new PEM-encoded string.

    Args:
        privatekey: The private key to use as input.

    Returns:
        A new private key.
